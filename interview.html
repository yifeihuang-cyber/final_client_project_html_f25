      <h2>Behavioral Interview Questions</h2>
      <h3>Behavioral Interview Questions Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Behaviour Questions can help employers check whether the candidate has the common competencies they are looking for. Competencies are the skills, knowledge, and behaviors that contribute to successful job performance. Examples of competencies include teamwork, communication, problem-solving, leadership, adaptability, and time management. Employers use behavioral interview questions to assess how candidates have demonstrated these competencies in their past experiences. The idea is that past behavior is a good predictor of future performance. By asking candidates to provide specific examples of how they have handled situations in the past, employers can gain insights into their skills, abilities, and potential fit for the role.Common behavior questions are:<br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tell me about yourself</li>
            <li>Give an example of a time where you were the lead on a difficult project.</li>
            <li>Describe your leadership skills.</li>
            <li>Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership skills. </li>
        </ul>

            (S/T) I volunteered for (and was nominated the head of) a committee of 4 people tasked with investigating poor customer reviews. <br>
